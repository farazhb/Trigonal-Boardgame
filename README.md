## Trigonal-Boardgame

<!-- ####  -->

Java boardgame to play over network. Players take turns filling each turn with their player color, one triangle on a 2D trigonal board given some rules, partly flexible ones decided on at the start of a game instance. At the end, scores are determined based on the control area of the players, and a winner is declared.

### History

This project was produced after reading the book "Introduction to Programming Using Java" by David J. Eck. The networking classes, .java files, are pretty much copies from the book, modified to work with the game. The program is in production.

-- 2016-5     The program was first developed with the different implemented over a couple of months.
- 2018-2-23   Uploaded the project onto github in same folder structure as in the workspace; the .java files and res folder would have been sufficient to compile and run the program. Attempt to add background image to tiles of respective players.

### Note

This game is not operational for over-network playing. I borrowed the network class from a book I was studying Java from (David J. Eck, "Introduction to Programming Using Java") and integrated it into the game but was never able to make it work, so practically it can be played on the same machine. Also, it's rather basic in graphics, as in there isn't any smooth animation or sophisticated texture. Last I was trying to embed images for the board background and the board pieces. Shortly after that, I abandoned its development for life-professional reasons.
