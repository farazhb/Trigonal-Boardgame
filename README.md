Java boardgame to play over network

This project was produced after reading the book "Introduction to Programming Using Java" by David J. Eck. The networking classes, .java files, are pretty much copies from the book, modified to work with the game. The program is in production.

- 2018-2-23   Uploaded the project onto github in same folder structure as in the workspace; the .java files and res folder would have been sufficient to compile and run the program. Attempt to add background image to tiles of respective players.
